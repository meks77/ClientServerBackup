# ClientServerBackup
A backup system where the admin can see the backup state of all backed clients. It should also run on low resources servers and on Synology NAS. It is similar to "Active Backup" from Synology, but can be run on any Java supported operating system and NAS models, which are currently not supported by Synology.
